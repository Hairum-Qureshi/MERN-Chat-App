## Things learned and need to improve on:

1. Utilizing middleware more - especially for handling authentication
2. Learn more about express-async-handler and consider using it in future projects
3. Learn more about Mongoose/MongoDB because there's still A LOT to learn about it

## Things to improve on for next time:

1. When User A searches for User B, it creates a contact in the backend between both users, however, the contact for User B should only appear for User A, but what happens is, User A gets User B's contact to appear and User B gets User A's contact to appear despite the fact User A hadn't sent User B a message yet.

## Future things to implement:

1. A feature where users can block other users

2. A feature where users can delete chats

3. A feature where users can send other users images/files

4. A feature where users can get DM notifications

5. A feature where a notification bubble appears next to the chat that received a new notification and the other user hasn't read it yet

6. A better UI design

7. Allowing users to create group chats

8. A feature to show read receipts
